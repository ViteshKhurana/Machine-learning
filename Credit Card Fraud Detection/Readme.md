About
=====
I am sick and tired of all the confirmation messages that I receive regarding my credit card been used, requesting to respond if it was not me. And not just credit card,
take any online payment medium, they always annoy you with their wild confirmation messages. I sometimes wonder why can’t they be convinced enough to message me just when 
there, actually is, something dubious happening. I bet you do too. But Credit Card Fraud is one of the biggest issues faced by the government and the amount of money involved
in this is generally enormous. So let’s see what are the challenges faced by such service providers. What are the strategies that we have adopted to -tackle this gargantuan 
problem and also why is it, that you get harassed so frequently via these messages?
